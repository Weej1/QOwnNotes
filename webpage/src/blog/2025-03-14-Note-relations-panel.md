# Note relations panel

<BlogDate v-bind:fm="$frontmatter" />

The note relations panel shows the **relations between the current note and linked notes** several levels deep.

![note-relations](/screenshots/screenshot-note-relations.png)

Relations between notes can be created by **linking to another note**, for example with the _Note link_ dialog.

The syntax for a note link is for example `[My note](path/to/My%20note.md)`.

You can turn on the panel in the _Window / Panels_ menu.

For more information visit the [note relations](../getting-started/note-relations.md) page.
