# Note relations panel

The note relations panel shows the **relations between the current note and linked notes** several levels deep.

- Relations between notes can be created by **linking to another note**, for example with the _Note link_ dialog
- The syntax for a note link is for example `[My note](path/to/My%20note.md)`
- You can turn on the panel in the _Window / Panels_ menu
- The panel allows zooming with the mouse wheel, and you can double-click on a note to open it
- Gathering of relations is done in the background, so you can continue working while the relations are being gathered
