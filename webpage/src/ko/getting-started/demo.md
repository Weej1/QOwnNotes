# QOwnNotes 데모

:: 팁 노트 데모 환경의 현재 상태에 따라 항상 작동하지 않을 수도 있습니다. :::

다음 지침에 따라 **QOwnNotes**를 설치하지 않고도 웹 브라우저에서 사용해 볼 수 있습니다:

1. Click on this [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qownnotes/docker-desktop/main/examples/docker-compose.play-with-docker.yml&stack_name=desktop) link.
2. Click the **Login / Start** button (see screenshot bullet **1**) and login with your Docker account (you need to create one if you don't already have one).

3. 컨테이너가 생성되고 회전할 때까지 기다립니다. Then you should be able to click on **6080** on the top (see screenshot bullet **2**). If you get an error please wait a bit more and try to click _6080_ again, it takes a while for the desktop environment to load.

4. A new browser tab should open producing a desktop. Click on the **bottom left symbol** on the screen (in the task bar), hover over **Accessories** and click on **QOwnNotes** (see screenshot bullet **3**).
