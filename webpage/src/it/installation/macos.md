# Installa su macOS™

Scarica l'ultima **immagine del disco macOS** da [QOwnNotes Releases su GitHub](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/releases), aprila e trascina l'app **QOwnNotes** nella tua **cartella delle applicazioni**.

The first time you have to right-click the application and click **Open** to open QOwnNotes.

The GitHub release `QOwnNotes.dmg` is a **universal binary**, built with **Qt6**. You need at least macOS 13 (Ventura) to run the universal binary.

The Qt5 legacy version is available as `QOwnNotesQt5.dmg`. You can't use the internal updater with this version, so you have to download new versions manually.

::: warning
If you get an error message `QOwnNotes.app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified` you need to visit your macOS **Security settings** and click on `Open anyway`.

To take the application out of the quarantine you can also run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/QOwnNotes.app
```

:::

::: tip
The application uses its **internal updater** to update itself. You can see the latest version on the bottom right of the application.
